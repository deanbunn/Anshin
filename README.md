### Anshin

#####A Bash script to regularly backup settings off my various Linux systems.

Even with switching to storing most data in cloud storage, I would find that I missed local config settings, desktop images, or documents I quickly stored locally. This Bash script dynamically pulls the local resources and copies them to a folder sync to cloud storage client.
